Currently I am working as a project manager and lead developer intern on an agile-driven team with Cardinal Spirits LLC in Bloomington, Indiana. Our team is composed of myself, two UX designers/front end developers, and a data scientist. We are working to build a responsive MEAN stack web application. 


I am also working as an undergraduate instructor with Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. I teach one lab section of INFO-I 101 Introduction to Informatics. In this class students recieve an introduction to the following:
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Python
- SQL

Students also are required to participate in individual and group projects based in web development. The key objectives in the class are to learn problem solving and communication skills.
