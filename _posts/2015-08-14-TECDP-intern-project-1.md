title: TECDP Intern Project 2015
---
For the summer of 2015, I took a role as an application developer with Cigna's Technology Early Career Development Program, and as part of that, I worked as an application developer for a mobile web application targeting caregivers. I worked on a team of thirty interns in a subteam of seven.

This application leveraged several technologies:

* Twitter Bootstrap
* Angular Javascript
* HTML5

My team presented this application to a panel made up of leaders in the company's IT department, including the company's Global Chief Information Officer, and was awarded first place among all teams to present.
