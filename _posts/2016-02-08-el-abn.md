When I was studying at the Complutense University of Madrid, I took a course called Informatics Tools Oriented for the Instruction of the Spanish Language. As a part of this course, I managed technical support for a team of four linguistics students. In this role I taught my team the fundamentals of web development and managed a website to display the project's contents. I was also the lead for all technical support members in the class. As a part of this, I gave several lectures on basic HTML and CSS and assisted with the creation and maintenance of seven other project websites. 

The entirety of communication done in these roles was in Spanish.

My team's project details four different technologies useful to those who do research in the field of linguistics, including online dictionaries and corpora. You can find the finished project site [here](http://elabn.weebly.com/)
