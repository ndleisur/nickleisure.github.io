title: Raúl Zurita
---

During my time as a student at the Complutense University of Madrid, I developed a responsive web application for a project taken on for a class - Hispanoamerican Literature - with collaborative partner Meredith Goodall. This project was an analisis of Raúl Zurita's life as an author and of some of his works. Meredith created all content, and I created all HTML and CSS files.

This application leveraged Twitter Bootstrap.

The entire project can be found [here](https://github.com/ndleisur/Ra-l-Zurita) on my github.
