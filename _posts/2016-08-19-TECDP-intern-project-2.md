title: TECDP Intern Project 2016
---
For the summer of 2016, I took a role as a project manager with Cigna's Technology Early Career Development Program, and as part of that, I worked as an application developer for a mobile web application with a virtual reality component targeting millennials with mental health issues. I worked on a team of eight interns in a subteam of four developers.

This application leveraged several technologies:

* Twitter Bootstrap
* Angular Javascript
* A-Frame HTML (Virtual Reality Framework)

I effectively presented this application to a panel made up of leaders in the company's IT department, including the company's Vice President of Information Technology.
