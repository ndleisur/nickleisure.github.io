My name is Nick Leisure, and I am currently an undergraduate student at Indiana University Bloomington pursuing dual degrees in Computer Science with a minor in Informatics and Spanish with minors in Latino Studies and General Linguistics. I plan to graduate in August 2017.

Here I have a collection of the work I have done across a number of different fields and mainly with technology.

This semester I am continuing my work with both the IU School of Informatics and Computing and the IU Global Village Living-Learning Center as an instructor for their INFO-I 101 Introduction to Informatics and GLLC-Q 199 Introduction to the Global Village courses, respectively. I am also doing development work with the ServeIT Non-Profit Clinic for the Monroe County Soil and Water Conservation District in my local community.

For the summer of 2016, I undertook an internship in project management with Cigna's Technology Early Career Development Program (TECDP) in Hartford, CT. This was my second summer with Cigna.

Outside of work and school I am passionate about education, and I find teaching to be the most fulfilling way to give back to a community, whether teaching Spanish to preschoolers or mobile app development to underprivileged youth. I also have an interest in current events on international, national, and local levels. 

For fun, I like to travel and read. I have currently been to 13 countries on three continents, and I am planning to travel to my fourth continent in December when I visit India. My current travel goal is to reach all seven continents by the time I am 25.
